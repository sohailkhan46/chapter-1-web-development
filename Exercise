                <p>
                    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of
 having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was read but it had no 
 pictures or conversations in 1t, land What is the use of a book" thought Alice 'without pictures or
                    conversations?"

                </p>
                <p>
                  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her
feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up
and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

                    There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so
                    very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’
                    (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,but at
                    the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually , and looked at it, and then hurried
                    on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
                    with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across
                    the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the
                    hedge.
